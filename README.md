## Other Recipes


- **Bucket Crafting**  
  Craft two **buckets** using three **steel ingots** in the same pattern as the vanilla bucket recipe.  

- **Improved Flint and Steel**  
  Craft a **Flint and Steel** using **flint** and a **steel ingot** (flint above steel ingot).  
  This tool works like the vanilla flint and steel, but has **4x the durability (256 uses)**.
  
- **Rail Crafting**  
  Craft **24 rails** using **steel ingots** and **logs**.
  The vanilla recipe using sticks and iron creates 16 rails.
